## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

# Prerequisites

Before you begin setting up and running the Employee Management System, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured on your system:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK):**
   - Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
   - You can download the latest JDK from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use an alternative JDK like OpenJDK.

2. **MySQL Database:**
   - The Employee Management System relies on a MySQL database to store employee information.
   - Install and configure MySQL on your system. You can download MySQL from [the official MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) or use a package manager suitable for your operating system.

3. **Database Setup:**
   - Create a MySQL database for the Employee Management System.
   - Configure the database connection details in the project code, particularly in the `Conn.java` file.
   - I have the sql queries as Database.txt file run it

4. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):**
   - A Java IDE is recommended for a smooth development experience. You can use popular IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - The project utilizes Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI) and may have additional dependencies.
   - Ensure that you have the necessary libraries or dependencies referenced in your project.

## Setting Up the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Import the project into your preferred Java IDE.
3. Configure the database connection in the `Conn.java` file.
4. Run the `Login.java` file to start the Employee Management Systems

Now you are ready to use and contribute to the project!
